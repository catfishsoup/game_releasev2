# Videa - Game Release V2 
Improvised version two of my first website, [Game Release](https://github.com/catfishsoup/game_releasev1), made with React, SCSS, Firebase, and everything in between that may be needed to build the application!

## About
The web application purpose is helping user keep track of game releases and managing their library. 
Check out the demo of Game Release version 2, Videa, to demonstrate my growth as a developer: game-releasev2.vercel.app
